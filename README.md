Fantasy Life Request Tracking Tool V2.0

Using the Program:

-------------Maps and Buttons-------------

- The left side is all the map buttons.
- The right side has option buttons at the top and a list of requests below them.
- You can hover over the map buttons to see the name of the location.
- The program's title changes depending on which buttons you have clicked, telling you the location and which option button was pressed.
- Selecting a location on the left will change the request list to show only
	quests associated with that particular location. If you choose "ALL" then
  all quest locations will show (this is the default option when you open
	the program). If you choose "LIVES" then only Life Challenges will show.
- Selecting from the options at the top right will change the request list to show
	only request that are unobtained, obtained, completed, or turned in depending
	on the option you chose. If you choose all, then all quests will show.
- If you select a location, the program remembers which option button you have chosen.
	For example, if you had chosen "Obtained Requests" in East Grassy Plains and
	now you choose West Grassy Plains, you will see the obtained requests in West
	Grassy Plains.
- Similarly, if you select a option button, the program will remember which location
	you have chosend. For example, if you had chosen to see the "Completed Requests"
	in East Grassy Plains and now you switch to "Obtained Requests," you will see
	the obtained requests in East Grassy Plains.

-------------Text Below Buttons-------------

- The text below each button shows #/#/#/#
- The first number is the unobtained requests in that area. These are requests you can
	pick up by going to that area and talking to the proper NPC.
- The second number is the obtained requests in that area. These are requests you can work
	on by going to that area. For example, if you need to kill bandits for a request,
	the second number under "East Grassy Plains" would increase by 1 because you need
	to go there to complete that request.
- The third number is the completed requests in that area. These are requests that are
	finished but havenot been turned in yet. The NPC to turn in the request is located
	on that map.
- The fourth number is the turned in requests in that area. These are requests that you
	have already turned in to the NPC that is located in that area.

-------------Request List-------------

- Under the "Complete" column is a drop down menu.
  - Choose Unobtained if you do not have the request (default option)
  - Choose Obtained if you have the request
  - Choose Completed if you have finished doing the request
  - Choose Turned In if you have turned in the request to the NPC

- The "NPC" column is the name of the NPC associated with the request
- The "Life" column shows you the life associated with the request, but only if it is
	a "life challenge" and not an "other request"
- The "Rank" column shows the rank associated with the request. All "life challenges" will
	show a rank but only some "other requests" show a rank.
- The "Name" column shows the name of the request. If you click on it, it will take you to
	a wiki page. Usually the wiki page will be for whatever object you need or whatever
	enemy you need to kill etc.
= The "Desc" column shows what is required for the request.
- The "Turn In" column shows where you obtain or turn in the request.
- The "Location" column shows where you go to work on a request. If you click on an option,
  the program will automatically switch to that location. It will also switch to "Obtained Requests."
  Use this if you want to quickly go to a location where you can work on that particular request.
